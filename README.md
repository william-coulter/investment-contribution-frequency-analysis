# What?

This explores how investment frequency affects potential returns in a high-variance .

I use the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to obtain a distrubtion of expected returns and compare these across various variance, investment frequency and timeframes.

# Results

I found that increasing the investment frequency shifts the distrubtion of expected returns "right", meaning you see a higher likelihood of expected gains and a lower likehood of losses.

I don't have screenshots of graphs all the graphs but here is one from 1 analysis:

You can see that investing `weekly` shifts the distribution _slighty_ to the right compared to `quarterly` (a tiny bit haha).

So if you can find an investment platform that doesn't charge trading fees (like Vanguard or Betashares), you should invest as frequently as possible to "dampen" losses.
