# What?

This explores how investment frequency affects potential returns in a high-variance .

I use the [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to obtain a distrubtion of expected returns and compare these across various variance, investment frequency and timeframes.

# Results

I don't have screenshots of graphs.

I found that increasing the investment frequency shifts the distrubtion of expected returns "right", meaning you see a higher likelihood of expected gains and a lower likehood of losses.

So if you can find an investment platform that doesn't charge trading fees (like Vanguard or Betashares), you should invest as frequently as possible to "dampen" losses.
